      Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
      Lorem Ipsum has been the <b>industry's standard</b> dummy text ever since the
      1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scra-bled it to
      make a type specimen book. <strong>Avtar Singh</strong> has survived not only five centuries, but
      also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
      unchanged. <i>It was popularised</i> in the 1960s with the release of Letraset
      sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
      publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem
      Ipsum.Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.

      Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin
      literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney
      College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and
      going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes
      from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero,
      written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first
      line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
